<h3>General Critique</h3>
<p>Individuals that tested our application agreed that it is fairly straight forward and easy to use, it gives them a sense of credibiity that an online based store should give them. Although almost all users hated the prices that were stated for each item because they were too high. The general layout of the site was also despised by participants. Another problem was, it was difficult for the user to identify the navigation link to the home page from product page. Text size on the home page is another problem, heading text for "featured products" and "new products" had poor visibility. When products are added to the cart there is no message so it seams like nothing is added.

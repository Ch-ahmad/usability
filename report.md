<h3>General Critique</h3>
<p>Individuals that tested our application agreed that it is fairly straight forward and easy to use, it gives them a sense of credibiity that an online based store should give them. Although almost all users hated the prices that were stated for each item because they were too high. The general layout of the site was also despised by participants.

<h3>Changes to be made based of critque</h3>
<p>Reduce White space</p>

<p>Add colour in Nav Bar</p>
<p>Fix form resubmisson issue</p>
<p>Add prices for shipping</p>
